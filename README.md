# UMiami-School-Scripts
This is going to have scripts that I have written at school (UMiami) that are not perfect and I don't necessarily know if I want other people to be able to see. 
Ok, just kidding, it looks like I can't make it private yet. I thought I could get a couple of free repositories with a .edu email address, but it looks like it is not free. 
These scripts are going to have some problems, but I want them on here for my future reference anyway.
